- **Feature:** Complete Chakra UI v3 compatibility fixes and frontend migration completion
- **Progress:**
  - Fixed ChakraProvider configuration with proper `defaultSystem` import and value prop
  - Replaced all numeric `gap` props with string values for Chakra UI v3 compatibility
  - Updated Stack components (HStack, VStack) across all components to use proper prop format
  - Fixed Grid component gap props in App.tsx, DashboardWidget, and other components
  - Successfully resolved all TypeScript compilation and runtime errors
  - Verified frontend builds successfully with no errors (only minor linting warnings)
  - Frontend development server running successfully on <http://localhost:5178>
  - All converted components (ActionCard, RequestModal, RequestToolbar, DashboardWidget, PendingRequestsCard) render correctly
- **Challenges:**
  - Chakra UI v3 changed prop format requirements from numeric to string values for spacing
  - Stack components no longer accept `spacing` prop, require `gap` with string values
  - Multiple components had inconsistent gap prop usage that needed systematic fixing
  - Build process revealed compatibility issues that weren't apparent during development
- **Solutions:**
  - Systematically replaced all `gap={number}` with `gap="number"` across all components
  - Used MultiEdit tool with replace_all flag to efficiently update multiple occurrences
  - Tested both development server and production build to ensure complete compatibility
  - Verified all components render correctly with proper spacing and layout
- **Insights:**
  - Chakra UI v3 has stricter prop type requirements that improve type safety
  - String-based spacing values provide better consistency with CSS standards
  - Systematic testing of both dev and build processes catches compatibility issues early
  - Complete migration requires attention to both major API changes and subtle prop format differences
