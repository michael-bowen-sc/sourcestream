**Entry:**

* **Feature:** Initial project setup.
* **Progress:**
  * Created `GEMINI.md` to provide project guidelines for the AI assistant.
  * Created a `.gitignore` file for Go and TypeScript projects.
  * Added `markdownlint-cli` with a basic configuration file.
  * Created this `DEVLOG.md` file to track project progress.
* **Challenges:**
  * The initial attempt to create the `.gitignore` file using `gitignore-cli` and `gibo` failed. I had to fetch the content from GitHub directly.
* **Solutions:**
  * Used `web_fetch` to get the `.gitignore` content from the official GitHub repository.
* **Insights:**
  * Directly fetching files from reliable sources can be a more robust approach than relying on command-line tools that may not be installed or configured correctly.
