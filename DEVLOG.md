**Entry:**

*   **Feature:** Initial project setup.
*   **Progress:**
    *   Created `GEMINI.md` to provide project guidelines for the AI assistant.
    *   Created a `.gitignore` file for Go and TypeScript projects.
    *   Added `markdownlint-cli` with a basic configuration file.
    *   Created this `DEVLOG.md` file to track project progress.
*   **Challenges:**
    *   The initial attempt to create the `.gitignore` file using `gitignore-cli` and `gibo` failed. I had to fetch the content from GitHub directly.
*   **Solutions:**
    *   Used `web_fetch` to get the `.gitignore` content from the official GitHub repository.
*   **Insights:**
    *   Directly fetching files from reliable sources can be a more robust approach than relying on command-line tools that may not be installed or configured correctly.
