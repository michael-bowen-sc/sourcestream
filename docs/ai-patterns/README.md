This directory contains documentation of effective patterns for AI-human pair programming that have proven successful in this project.

## Contents

- `prompts/`: Example prompts that work well for specific tasks
- `workflows/`: Documented workflows combining AI and human steps
- `templates/`: Templates for common tasks that AI can help with

## Best Practices

1. **Provide Clear Context**: Always include relevant files and background when asking for AI assistance
2. **Incremental Changes**: Break large tasks into smaller steps for better AI comprehension
3. **Verification**: Always verify AI-generated code before committing
4. **Learning Loop**: Document what works and what doesn't to improve future interactions
