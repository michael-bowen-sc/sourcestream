# AI-User Pair Programming Documentation

This document outlines guidelines and best practices for effective pair programming between AI tools and human developers on the SourceStream project.

## Core Principles

1. **Clear Communication**: Provide context, expectations, and specific requirements when working with AI
2. **Iterative Development**: Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable chunks
3. **Knowledge Sharing**: Document successful patterns and challenges for team learning
4. **Quality Verification**: Always review and test AI-generated code

## Interaction Patterns

### 1. Feature Planning

When starting a new feature:
1. Describe the feature and its requirements to the AI
2. Ask AI to outline implementation steps and potential challenges
3. Review and refine the plan together
4. Break down into actionable tasks

### 2. Code Generation

For optimal code generation:
1. Provide clear context about the codebase
2. Specify architectural patterns to follow
3. Define expected inputs/outputs and error handling
4. Include examples of similar code when available

### 3. Code Review

AI can help review code by:
1. Identifying potential bugs or edge cases
2. Suggesting performance improvements
3. Checking for security vulnerabilities
4. Ensuring consistency with project standards

### 4. Documentation

Collaborate with AI to maintain:
1. Technical documentation
2. API specifications
3. Development logs
4. Knowledge base of solutions

## Tools and Integration

- **IDE Integration**: Use AI assistants directly in VS Code
- **Version Control**: Include AI in code reviews via PR comments
- **Documentation**: Maintain AI-specific documentation in `/docs/ai-patterns/`

## Learning and Improvement

- Document successful prompt patterns
- Track areas where AI assistance was most valuable
- Identify knowledge gaps where AI needs more context
- Regularly update AI guidelines as the project evolves
